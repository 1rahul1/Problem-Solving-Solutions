/*
We have to check the that tree or not . Now degree is the number of edges coming or going out from one node .So , here the number of degrees
are given . We know that the number of edges of tree (N nodes) are N-1 edges. Think about that one edge contributes two degrees.
So , the number of edges (N-1) will be equal to the twice of the total degrees .
